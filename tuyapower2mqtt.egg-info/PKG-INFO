Description: # TuyaPower2MQTT - PyPi Module
        Author: Phill Healey

        # Description
        Python module to pull power and state data from Tuya / Smart Life / Jinvoo WiFi smart socket/switch devices.  _Tested on RaspberryPi, Linux, Windows 10 and MacOS._ 
        
        Compatible with Home Assistant.
        
        # Preparation
        All python dependencies for TuyaPower2MQTT will be automatically installed. However, you may need to install ```python-crypto``` via apt/yum/etc. If this is your first pip package then you may also need to install ```python-pip```.
        
        ```bash
         sudo apt-get install python-crypto python-pip		
        ```
        
        You'll need a Mosquitto (MQTT) server to publish the data to. If you don't already have one running, I recommend following this simple tutorial: [Installing an MQTT server on Debian](https://medium.com/@rossdanderson/installing-mosquitto-broker-on-debian-2a341fe88981). Note, you can try installing MQTT without adding the repo suggested in the first step.

        * deviceInfo - Poll device and return on, w, mA, V and err data.
        ```python
        tuyapower.deviceInfo(PLUGID, PLUGIP, PLUGKEY, PLUGVERS)
        ```
        
        # Usage
        Gathers full power stats / data from Tuya sockets &amp; switches and reports results as JSON via MQTT
